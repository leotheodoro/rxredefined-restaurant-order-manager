# RxRedefined â€“ Restaurant Order Manager

Technical test for RxRedefined - Restaurant Order Manager. Using Express.js & PostgreSQL

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Step-by-step instructions:

```bash
# 1. Install all dependencies
npm ci

# 2. Duplicate the env template and adjust if necessary
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Launch PostgreSQL via Docker Compose
docker compose up -d

# 4. Run database migrations
npm run db:migrate

# 5. Start the application in watch mode
npm run dev
```

You should see this:
```
Server is running on port 3333 in development mode
```

In order to test the routes, I had some free time before delivering the test, so I add Swagger that you can access through `/docs` and test through there. ;)

## ðŸ§ª Running Unit Tests

```bash
npm test
```

I used in-memory layer repositories to run unit tests.

I also added unit tests to run on the CI (Github Workflows), so you can see the tests running there.
